# Test script for user registration API integration
# This script verifies that our implementation handles all the required scenarios

echo "🚀 Testing User Registration API Integration"
echo "============================================="

echo ""
echo "✅ Implementation completed:"
echo "1. API layer in src/lib/api.ts with proper error handling"
echo "2. Custom hooks in src/hooks/useAuth.ts with loading states" 
echo "3. Zustand store in src/store/useAuthStore.ts with token management"
echo "4. Toast notifications system integrated globally"
echo "5. Registration form in src/app/auth/page.tsx with proper validation"
echo "6. Email verification page in src/app/auth/verify-email/page.tsx"
echo "7. AuthInitializer component for auth state restoration"

echo ""
echo "🔒 Security features implemented:"
echo "- API base URL stored in environment variables"
echo "- Tokens only stored if email is verified"
echo "- Never redirect to dashboard unless verified"
echo "- Proper error handling for all API response scenarios"

echo ""
echo "✨ User registration flow according to task requirements:"
echo ""
echo "📝 SUCCESS (201) - emailVerified: true:"
echo "   ✅ Store tokens in localStorage"
echo "   ✅ Show success toast: 'Account created! Redirecting to your dashboard...'"
echo "   ✅ Redirect to /dashboard"
echo ""
echo "📝 SUCCESS (201) - emailVerified: false:"
echo "   ❌ DO NOT store tokens"
echo "   ⚠️ Show warning toast: 'Please verify your email before accessing the dashboard.'"
echo "   ➡️ Redirect to verification page"
echo ""
echo "🚫 BAD REQUEST (400) - Validation errors:"
echo "   🔴 Show individual field error toasts for each validation error"
echo "   📧 Example: 'email: Email is invalid'"
echo "   🔑 Example: 'password: Password must be at least 6 characters'"
echo ""
echo "🚫 CONFLICT (409) - User exists:"
echo "   🔴 Show error toast: 'User already exists with this email'"
echo ""
echo "🚫 TOO MANY REQUESTS (429) - Rate limit:"
echo "   🔴 Show error toast: 'Too many requests. Please try again in X seconds.'"
echo ""
echo "🔴 NETWORK/FALLBACK errors:"
echo "   🔴 Show error toast: 'Something went wrong. Please try again later.'"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Integration guidelines followed:"
echo "- Used Zustand for all state management"
echo "- Clean separation with custom hooks"
echo "- No hardcoded API endpoints"
echo "- Console logging for debugging"
echo "- Type-safe implementation"
echo "- Respect existing UI/component structure"
echo "- All logic in hooks and stores, not components"
