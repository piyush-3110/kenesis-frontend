# Module Update Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Type Conversion Errors
- **Problem**: `duration` was being sent as string instead of number
- **Problem**: `isRequired` was being sent as string instead of boolean
- **Solution**: Enhanced `updateModuleWithProperTypes` method to properly convert types

### 2. Unwanted Fields Removal
Removed the following fields from module updates:
- `prerequisites`
- `learningOutcome` / `learningOutcomes` 
- `resource` / `resources`
- `content`
- `contentTitle`
- `section`
- Any fields containing `content[` or `learningObjectives[`

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to track:
- Which fields are being excluded
- Type conversions being applied
- Final data structure with types
- Both FormData and JSON paths

## Code Changes Made

### In `src/lib/api.ts`:

1. **Enhanced `updateModuleWithProperTypes` method**:
   - Added field filtering to exclude unwanted fields
   - Improved type conversion for both FormData and JSON paths
   - Added proper handling for `duration`, `order` (numbers) and `isRequired`, `isPreview` (booleans)
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

2. **Updated `UpdateModuleRequest` interface**:
   - Added comments explaining which fields are supported
   - Documented that legacy fields are no longer supported

## Expected Behavior Now

### When updating a module:
1. **Field Filtering**: Unwanted fields will be excluded automatically
2. **Type Conversion**: 
   - `duration` and `order` will be converted to numbers
   - `isRequired` and `isPreview` will be converted to booleans
3. **Detailed Logging**: Console will show:
   ```
   ðŸš« Excluding field: prerequisites
   ðŸš« Excluding field: learningOutcomes
   ðŸ§¹ Cleaned FormData entries:
     âœ… title: Updated Module Title (string)
     âœ… duration: 300 (string) -> will convert to number
     âœ… isPreview: true (string) -> will convert to boolean
   ```

### Two execution paths:
1. **With Files**: Uses FormData with proper type conversions
2. **Without Files**: Converts to JSON with proper number/boolean types

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Try updating a module with duration and isPreview fields
2. Check browser console for the detailed logging
3. Verify that the backend receives proper types:
   - `duration` as number
   - `isPreview` as boolean
   - No unwanted fields like `prerequisites`, `learningOutcomes`, etc.

## What to Look For in Console

### Success indicators:
- `ðŸš« Excluding field: [fieldname]` for unwanted fields
- `âœ… duration: 300 (string)` in FormData, then `âœ… duration: 300 (number)` in JSON conversion
- `âœ… isPreview: true (boolean)` in final data
- No validation errors from backend

### If still getting errors:
- Check if new field names are being sent that need type conversion
- Verify that the form is sending the correct field names
- Look for any other string values that should be numbers/booleans
